# Hi there!

We're a team of two and proud to present to you our entry for the Ludum Dare 42. Thank you very much for checking it!

This was only our second and first jam ever and we had no graphist or sound designer at all this time around so we went for an abstract game that would require very little graphics and only basic sound design. This was all done without any external asset.
The game was developed using Lua (and LÃ¶ve2D), a language none of us had more than theoretic knowledge of prior to the start of the game jam.

We hope you will enjoy playing it! Feel free to give us any feedback

# The Game
The Nether has broken into reality and is devouring it ! You must outrun it... by accessing tinier and tinier scales !

Each level will present you a number of Reality Fragments (yellow) you must collect to be able to access a lower scale of reality that the Nether hasn't corrupted... yet. Be quick and leave it before it is devoured, or buy yourself some time by grabbing Reality Crafters (blue) ! You can delve into the Nether but only for a short time, and you might not come back unscathed.
