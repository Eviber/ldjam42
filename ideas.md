* an invisible wall before the border of the screen might be interesting to not lose inexperienced players
* the safe space at the beginning could use to have more keys (maybe only having one appearing at a time) to be sure the player is familiarized with the controls
* the direction indicator would probably be better by being a triangle instead of a square
* an iterative tutorial would still be useful. The controls being the real difficulty they are the biggest wall for newbies
